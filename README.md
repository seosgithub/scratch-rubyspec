Scratch is a ruby language implementation test framework based on RubySpec.  Scratch will help you verify that your ruby implementation meets the RubySpec standards.  Scratch relies on standard input and output to assess tests results instead of the internal tests that RubySpec relies on.  This simple testing procedure allows any ruby language implementation to be assessed whether or not that ruby implementation is able to run mspec.

Scratch was purpose built for [Jewel](https://github.com/sotownsend/Jewel)
